Tzoom
==========

A theme using the moodle_bootstrapbase derived Buckle as a parent. 

This theme takes the master bootstrapbase theme from core as its parent and then replaces the layout with Danny Wahl's 
Antioch layout (http://iyware.com/portfolio/antioch/) which uses Matthew James' Taylor's Holy Grail 3 column layout
(http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/ultimate-multi-column-liquid-layouts-em-and-pixel-widths) with @media calls for 
responsive behaviour.

It adjusts the default bootstrapbase layout to replace the traditional header area with the custom menu below allowing
the familiar branding rather than the small logo within the fixed custom menu. It also replaces the login info to
the right of that header along with the language menu, removing these from the custommenu bar.

In the main body of the page, the Tzoom theme replaces the default icons, many of which are hidden by the default
bootstrapbase theme and adds Font-Awesome Icons to block headers.

Settings have been used from Sean Daubney's Aardvark themes and are comprehensive allowing for menu colour, bacground colour/image, alerts, social media icons etc to be added to the frontpage as required.

The theme provides several css files
* reset.css - which contains specific overrides for the parent css
* pagelayout.css - the responsive 3column HolyGrail layout css
* dock.css - the css required for the dock
* core.css - the theme specific css
* custom.css - the final css file which applies the settings from the customcss setting box
* blockicons.css - the font-awesome icons associated with each block
* profilebar.css - styling for the profileblock in the menu
